# Animal_anatomy_site_Ethiopia
A website about the anatomy of domestic animals—including the cat, dog, sheep, goat, cattle, donkey, horse, camel, and chicken—that covers the skeletal, muscular, joint, and organ systems. For each system, the site should display the animal’s whole body (for example, the complete skeleton), allowing students to click on any part to learn its name and purpose.
